## Twenty One

An implementation of Blackjack. In this implementation, one player plays against the dealer. Initially, two cards are dealt to the player and the dealer each and one card of the dealer is hidden. After that, the player can either 'hit' or 'stay'. 'Hit' would deal the player another card while 'stay' would not. The objective of the game is to get as close to the value of 21 (by adding the values of the cards dealt) as possible without going over. The values of the cards are as follows:

  - Ace: Either 1 or 10. Depending on which value keeps the player from going over 21
  - 2  : 2
  - 3  : 3
  - 4  : 4
  - 5  : 5
  - 6  : 6
  - 7  : 7
  - 8  : 8
  - 9  : 9
  - 10 : 10
  - J  : 10
  - Q  : 10
  - K  : 10
